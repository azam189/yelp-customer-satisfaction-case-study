# 📍 What Drives Restaurant Visits? A Marketing Analytics Case Using Yelp Data

> **Role-aligned portfolio project – Marketing Analyst**
>
> This project analyzes customer engagement on Yelp to identify which digital and experiential factors influence real-world restaurant visits.

## Business Problem
Restaurant marketers invest in digital channels but often lack clarity on which signals actually drive customers to visit a location.

## Marketing Objective
- Understand drivers of customer check-ins (engagement → visits)
- Identify high-impact levers for marketing strategy
- Evaluate whether engagement metrics can predict performance

## KPI
- Daily Yelp Check-ins (proxy for foot traffic and customer interest)

## Data Used
- Yelp Business, Review, and Check-in data (Missouri)
- Weather data (external)
- Demographic data (median age)
- Engineered competitive density metrics

## Key Marketing Insights
- Review activity is the strongest predictor of check-ins
- Static features (parking, seating) have a limited standalone impact
- Engagement momentum matters more than one-time attributes

## Marketing Recommendations
- Encourage post-visit reviews via campaigns
- Focus on sustained engagement, not only physical features
- Use review volume as an early performance signal

## Limitations
- Check-ins used as a single engagement KPI
- Limited geographic scope
- Other marketing channels not included

## Tools
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, SQL
